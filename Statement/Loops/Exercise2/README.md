In this section, we create a program that uses both SEQUENTIAL and CONDITIONAL control flow.

program does the following:

1. ○ create a random int between 0 and 250
○ store the value of that int in a variable with the identifier of x
■ func Intn(n int) int
● rand.Intn()
○ print out the name and value of the variable
use an if statement to do the following
■ if the value is between 0 and 100
● print between 0 and 100
■ if the value is between 101 and 200
● print between 101 and 200
■ if the value is between 201 and 250
● print between 201 and 250

2. then modify the program to use a conditional logic statements
○ a switch statement to print out same results in no. 1.

And then, have the program use the init func to print.
 
 func init () {}

 3. Also, we created 2 random ints between 0 inclusive and 10 exclusive
○ assign them to variables with the identifiers a and b
● Print their values
● use an if statement to print the correct description
○ a and b are both less than 4
○ a and b are both greater than 6
○ a is greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 6
○ b is not 5
○ none of the previous cases were met

we modify the program to use a switch statement to print out the same results in no.3
